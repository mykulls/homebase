Homebase is a widgets-based Electron overlay designed for Windows with the goal of aiding in quality of life and multitasking. 
Inspired by Apple's widget system for Mac, these are made to allow for quick and easy controls/viewing without having to 
click around through tons of windows or swap back and forth between desktops just to adjust music settings or check my 
todos/calendar. Widgets are semi-transparent, both to allow you to still see content under them if necessary,
but also to make them less of a distraction when kept on the screen.

## Widgets
There are 3 widgets - a YouTube widget, a Spotify widget, and a Calendar widget. Each widget has two sizes, full size
and half height. The YouTube widget allows you to paste a link and have the video play on the side.
When resized to half size, the video playback is removed by audio will continue to play. This is useful for when
using YouTube purely as an audio source, for example, to play music on the side while working. The Spotify widget
prompts the user to login, and upon logging in allows them to remote control any Spotify playback from their account.
Finally, the Calendar widget uses an ics link to fetch a user's Calendar events of the day. I often use my Calendar
not only to schedule events for the day but also as a mini todo list, so this in essence kills two birds with one stone.

## Adding Widgets
Adding widgets can be done via the + button, which provides a menu for the 3 widgets and places them into the next available spot.
